# FreeCodeCamp - Team Member Allocation

This is a little project with a porpose of practice. All the content here is supposed to cover the basic concepts of ReactJS. The project itself is a solution for a case where a dev is developing for a software development company where a lot of developer are hired on a temporary basis and assigned to their relevant teams depending on the current projects being developed by the organization. Team members are moved between teams on a fairly regular basis depending on the current projects being developed by the organization. The team members agility is great, but keeping track of who belongs  to what team can be difficult for the development manager at times. Then, supposing that the development manager has asked to develop basic SPA application where he is able to use the app to allocate team members to their relevant teams, and can use the app to keep track of the teams and team members. This project was taught by [Gavin Lon](https://github.com/GavinLonDigital) at [FCC's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6gSSpfsoOQ&t=5843s)

### What I learned

I feel like increasing my knowledge about useState and useEffect, I know I have a long way to walk but I'm more confident in my skills and I'll now build project for my own, since this one was offered by FreeCodeCamp's team.
